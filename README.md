[Impact of Self-Driving Cars for Urban Development](https://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/impact-of-self-driving-cars-for-urban-development/viewer)

## What I find interesting about this article:
Lately I've been obsessed with self-driving cars, so I picked up the scholarly article, "Impact of Self-Driving Cars for Urban Development", by Aleksey Zomarev and Maria Rozhenko. This article implements research and analysis to estimate the impact that self-driving cars will have on cities, more specifically Moscow. The authors' reason for predicting the future of cars is to adopt a proactive transport policy to combat the uncertainty that autonomous vehicles will bring to the table. In order to do this, the authors used a dynamic model of the road and street network(SRN), as well as MATSim simulation to see how SRN will be affected. 

What I found interesting was how we assume self-driving vehicles will automatically make our lives better. The appeal will definitely be there. No more waiting for parking spots, waiting in traffic, or walking to your car. Every inconvenience will be automated. The problem revealed to me by this article is that by the year 2035, only one third of vehicles on the road will be autonomous. With more congestion there will be more accidents with conventional cars and a deteriorating road situation. This is the opposite outcome of the impact self-driving vehicles are expected to have. It is also predicited that transportation services will be the first to transmission to self-driving, with individuals following suit. This would take a toll on employment opportunities that consist of driving. 

However, the problem of slow adoption of self-driving cars can be combated with government regulations and incentives to purchase self-driving electric vehicles.

I agree with bjr's point that the appeal to the vision of a fully autonomous city full of self-driving cars heavily outweigh the reality that self-driving cars will arrive to in the short term. A lot of change has to happen socially, politically, and technically before the dream of autonomous cities comes alive. As these changes slowly happen, I'm sure we will see both the faults and benefits these technologies bring us.
